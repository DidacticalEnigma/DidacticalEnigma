Name...?
--------

The name was merged from two different autogenerated names from GitHub's "new repository" page. 

A little backstory: I picked up translating even though I had no clue about Japanese writing system, because it was a real-life motivation for me to actually learn Japanese. Having one of the sites I was relying on being offline for 3 days, and needing to cross check across 10 different browser pages made me consider unifying my workflow in a single program. 

Hence: "didactical" because it's a learning experience (both using and writing the program) and "enigma" because translating without knowing the language is sort of like deciphering Enigma ciphertexts.

This program is written by a total amateur. Advice from people who know Japanese is highly welcome!
